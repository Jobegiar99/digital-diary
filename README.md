   Yup! That's right, we've got our own personal discord server >:) and it allows us to monitor the repo! Bwahahah. 
  <br>
  Okay, time to get serious. Let me talk to you about the server:
</h3>

## Rules
- **Do not spam the channels**
- **Do not send messages on any channel where the Pokebots send notifications unless completely necesarry. Remember that the main focus of that server is monitoring updates!**

## Bots
#### The server contains five unique pokemon bots with their unique personality (or at least an attemp of giving them their own personality). Those are:
- **Mudkip Bot:** Notifies you about a new pull request<br>
![Image of new pull request notification](https://i.imgur.com/Kp9XfVB.png)
- **Chikorita Bot:** Notifies you about a new Front-End Issue!<br>
![Image of new FrontEnd Issue notification](https://i.imgur.com/1829hnd.png)
- **Torchic Bot:** Notifies you about a new Back-End Issue!<br>

- **Totodile Bot:** Notifies you about a new Documentation Issue!<br>

- **Jirachi Bot:** Notifies you about a new Wishlist Issue!<br>

_They work thanks to Github Actions!_

## Creating an Issue
**When creating an issue it is important that you add the corresponding label into it to allow everyone whose on the discord server know what the issue is! You must use the following labels:**
- **Frontend:** stuff related to...well the front-end
- **Backend:** same as above but with the back-end
- **Documentation:** any issue related to the design of the system, UI / UX, readme, etc.
- **Wishlist:** anything that does not enters in the above categories that you think that is something that our amazing project should have!

## Making code changes
- Fork and clone the repository git clone https://github.com/ShrillShrestha/digital-diary
- Create a branch git checkout -b "<your_branch_name>"
- Make your changes in that branch
- Test your changes
- Add and commit your changes with `git add .` && `git commit -m "<your_commit_message>"`
- Then push the changes into your branch git push origin branch_name
- Now you can create a PR using that branch in our repository.

## Pull Requests
**We all want to create some pull requests that get merged, but before you start working on it, please attach to this rules!**
- Make the name descriptive
- Prove a summary of the files changed on the description of the PR!
- Provide constructive feedback where it applies.
- If it does not get approved please don't get mad, it's a great learning experience and everyone is welcome to contribute! Read the feedback and keep trying! :)

## Some Useful tips
**Sometimes the main branch of our repo might be updated since the last time you forked it. It might create conflicts while merging the PR. In such case:**
- Add out repo as your upstream repo using `git remote add upstream https://github.com/ShrillShrestha/digital-diary`.
- Checkout to your main and pull the lastest changes from the `upstream` with `git pull upstream master`.
- If you want, you can push the latest main branch to update your origin's main with `git push origin main`.
- Checkout to your branch, where you made the changes.
- Rebase your branch to the latest main branch with `git rebase master`
- Resolve any conflicts, if any.
- Push the latest change to your origin.
