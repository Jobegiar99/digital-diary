   Yup! That's right, we've got our own personal discord server >:) and it allows us to monitor the repo! Bwahahah. 
  <br>
  Okay, time to get serious. Let me talk to you about the server:
  <h2> Rules </h2><br>
  <h4>
  - Do not spam the channels<br>
  - Do not send messages on any channel where the Pokebots send notifications unless completely necesarry. Remember that the main focus of that server is monitoring updates!
  </h4>
  <h2> Bots </h2><br>
  <h4> The server contains five unique pokemon bots with their unique personality (or at least an attemp of giving them their own personality).
    Those are:
  </h4>
  <b> Mudkip Bot </b>: Notifies you about a new pull request</h4>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/Kp9XfVB.png"/> 
  
  <b> Chikorita Bot </b>: Notifies you about a new Front-End Issue!</h4>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/1829hnd.png"/> 

 <b> Torchic Bot </b>: Notifies you about a new Back-End Issue!</h4>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/K3fEta8.png"/> 

 <b> Totodile Bot </b>: Notifies you about a new Documentation Issue!</h4>

 <b> Jirachi Bot </b>: Notifies you about a new Wishlist Issue!</h4>
<img src = "https://i.imgur.com/fnNxS5J.png"/> 

They work thanks to Github Actions!

- <b>documentation</b> : any issue related to the design of the system, UI / UX, readme, etc.<br>

<h1> Default React Stuff </h1>

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).
